# About Me

Hi, I'm Renato, a Software Developer.

I'm creating this project as a resume and portfolio.

However, I'm also using it to practice and expand my knowledge about frontend development.

## Projects in my portfolio

- [NLW #01 - Ecoleta](https://github.com/renatoalbjr/nlw-01)
- [NLW #09 - Esports](https://github.com/renatoalbjr/nlw-09)

## Inspiration

- Design inspired by [HTML5UP Hyperspace](https://html5up.net/hyperspace)
